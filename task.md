Create a chrome extension that allows you to select a set of personas..
each persona should have CSS change

for example, one persona would have text-transform lowercase and font-family monospace, another persona
could text-transform uppercase only, etc etc.. it's like giving a personality to a website..

also you need to label each persona something relevant..

so think of a few personas and create a chrome extension taht shows a popup to select one of the
personas and that CSS should get applied to the page.. also there should be some way to reset it 
to remove the persona changes.
